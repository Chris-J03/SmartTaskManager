This project was something I decided to undertake in my free time as a way of further developing my understanding of full stack development, something I previously have not done much of at all. 
The aim was to create clean maintainable code that had all the basic functionality a task manager app may require.
This was my first time using QtWidgets and I thoroughly enjoyed the learning experience as it felt so rewarding when it all came together.
